  This project is a C++ banking application designed to simulate investment growth calculations. It enables users to input their initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and the duration of the investment in years. The application calculates and displays the growth of the investment over time, including the end-of-year balance and earned interest, with and without additional monthly deposits. The problem it solves is providing users with a clear financial projection of their investments, helping them understand the impact of compound interest and how regular deposits can increase their investment growth over time.

What did you do particularly well?

  what it excelles in is user interaction and input validation, ensuring that inputs are valid and guiding the user through the process with clear prompts. The organization and modularity of the code, through well-defined functions and classes, showcased a solid understanding of object-oriented programming principles. This not only made the code more readable and extendable but also enhanced the overall user experience by making the application robust against invalid inputs.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

  Enhancements could be made by incorporating modern C++ features and improving error handling. Utilizing smart pointers could make the code more efficient. Implementing comprehensive error handling, including exception handling, could make the application more secure and robust against runtime errors. These improvements would not only optimize the application's performance but also enhance its reliability and user safety.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

  Implementing accurate financial calculations and robust input validation were challenging for me. Overcoming these challenges required a deep dive into mathematical principles behind investment growth and C++'s input and output management. Tools and resources such as the C++ documentation, financial textbooks, and online programming communities like Stack Overflow were invaluable. These resources provided the necessary guidance and knowledge to address the complexities of financial computations and input validation.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

   transferable skills from this project include problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, object-oriented programming, input validation, and error handling. These skills are fundamental across programming disciplines and will be beneficial in developing robust, user-friendly applications in any programming language. The ability to break down complex problems into manageable components and to rigorously validate and process user input are skills that will greatly enhance future projects and coursework.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  I made program maintainable, readable, and adaptable through several strategies. Clear documentation and comments within the code helped explain the purpose and functionality of different components, making it easier for future developers (or myself) to understand and modify the code. The modular design, with a clear separation of concerns and use of object-oriented principles, allowed for easy updates and feature additions. Consistent coding conventions and a structured approach to development ensured that the code remained organized and approachable, facilitating easier maintenance and adaptation to new requirements or technologies.
